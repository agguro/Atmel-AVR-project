# arduino-project
Collection of Arduino docs, tools, examples

WARNING:
I will not be held responsable for broken hardware, bricked MCUs
exploding electronics.  I did the projects myself with the greatest care
and yes I blew up leds and broke a powermodule (it was a Chinese one so
quite normal, my opinion), however I too can make mistakes.

know what you're doing.
