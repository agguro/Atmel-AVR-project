         ; description: turns led on port 13 on.
         ;              this is an example from https://www.instructables.com/Command-Line-Assembly-Language-Programming-for-Ard/
         ;              slightly modified for my own needs and coding style.
         ;              It turns on the LED which is connected to PB5 (digital out 13).
         
          .list
         
          start:
C:000000 ef0f          ldi      r16,0xFF ; r16 = 0xFF (255)
C:000001 b904          out      DDRB,r16 ; Out writes to SRAM, which is one way of accessing pins. DDRB controls PORTB's in/out state.
C:000002 e000          ldi      r16,0x00 ; r16 is where we'll store current LED state, 0x20 means pin 13 high.
C:000003 b905          out      PORTB,r16 ; set all B pins to current state. PORTB is where our favorite flashing pin is (pin 13)!

C:000004 cfff      	rjmp loop
